# Profile Tabs & Image Upload - Implementation Complete

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Tab Content Not Showing
**Problem**: Only the Overview tab showed content. Edit Profile, Settings, and Change Password tabs were empty.

**Root Cause**: Tab pane components were missing Bootstrap's `show active` classes.

**Solution**: Added `show active` classes to all tab pane components:
- ✅ ProfileEditForm
- ✅ PasswordChangeForm  
- ✅ SettingsForm

### 2. Profile Photo Upload Not Working

**Solution**: Created full-featured ProfileImageUpload component with:
- ✅ Image cropping with react-image-crop

## Technical Details

### Image Cropping Implementation

**Based on**: `app/static/assets/javascript/images/ProfileImageCropper.js`

**Features**:
- Circular crop (aspect ratio 1:1)
- Output size: 500x500px
- Rotation: -360° to +360°
- Zoom: 0.5x to 3x
- Format: JPEG (95% quality)
- Max file size: 20MB
- Min dimensions: 500x500px

**Process**:
1. User selects image
2. Image loads into crop area
3. User adjusts crop, rotation, zoom
4. Canvas creates 500x500px cropped image
5. Blob converted to File
6. Uploaded via ProfileService
7. Profile refetches with new image

### Tab Visibility Fix

**Before**:
```tsx
<div className="tab-pane fade profile-edit pt-3">
  {/* Content */}
</div>
```

**After**:
```tsx
<div className="tab-pane fade show active profile-edit pt-3">
  {/* Content */}
</div>
```

The `show active` classes ensure the tab content is visible when selected.

## API Integration
